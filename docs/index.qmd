## Quarto and Python

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable Python code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Python Code

When you render this document, it will include both the content and the output of the embedded Python code.

Here's a simple Python calculation:

```{python}
# This is a Python code chunk
a = 1
b = 1
result = a + b
```
